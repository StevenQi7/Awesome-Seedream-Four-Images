| <img src="cases/15/after.jpg" width="400" alt="Output Image">  

**Prompt:**

```
1. Design a Tarot card that uses mystical symbolic techniques to interpret [collective unconscious]. The card needs a classic decorative border, with a symbolic core image in the center, and Roman numerals and title along with Chinese description at the bottom. The overall style should be mysterious, vintage engraving style with rich symbolic colors.
2. Design a skill card from a fantasy RPG game that uses text and images to explain the economic concept of 'futures'. It should have a gamified skill name, cool icons, skill description (explaining the concept in gaming language), consumed 'energy points' and cooldown time. The overall style is dark fantasy with glowing magical rune borders.
3. Generate a card in the style of ancient immortal cultivation manuscripts, introducing [computer] to sect disciples. The card should adopt a combination of ink wash Chinese style and meticulous painting, ethereal and fairy-like, with elegant colors. In layout, the center should have a detailed illustration of the main subject, with relatively detailed regular script annotations in vertical arrangement beside it. The card should have classical borders of auspicious clouds or scroll patterns around it, with a clean background and plenty of white space, giving an overall texture like a page from a legendary secret manual.
4. Create a modern minimalist infographic that explains [Pomodoro Technique] to urban white-collar workers. The image should use bright, harmonious color blocks and clean flat icons, with information layout following visual guidance, using sans-serif fonts to annotate key steps or elements, with relatively detailed text introduction. The overall style should be clean and organized, similar to charts in high-end business analysis reports.

**Input 1:** Current PPT page content text
**Prompt 1:**

```
Role: You are now a top visual concept designer, specializing in transforming business or academic PPT content into visual image concepts with modern sense, spatial sense and high-quality texture. Your designs must be both aesthetically outstanding and precisely convey the inherent logic of the content.

Core Task: Your task is to receive PPT text content input from users (usually including a title and several key points), and create detailed, movie poster-level image generation prompts based on this content.

A movie poster-level visual work with minimalist and spatial style. Three frosted glass panels of different sizes with clear outlines, elegantly floating in the right half of the image. The largest glass panel is at the back, with the core formula "Variable = Breakthrough Point" etched in clean sans-serif white font; the two smaller glass panels in front are staggered, etched with "New Users = Breakthrough Point - Inertia" and "Breakthrough Point = Era Variable" respectively.

The glass material has a high-quality semi-transparent frosted texture with sharp edges that can catch light. A strong and focused spotlight shoots diagonally from the upper left of the image, penetrating the glass, forming soft halos and clear contour light on its surface, and casting layered soft long shadows on the dark background.

The background is a pure, slightly textured matte dark gray wall, creating a quiet and profound sense of space. The overall tone is calm, with extremely subtle blue tones in the light, giving the image a sense of technology and wisdom.

In composition, all visual subjects are strictly concentrated on the right side of the image, leaving a large area of clean background on the left side to achieve golden ratio and asymmetrical beauty, facilitating later typesetting and detailed text addition.

The final output image prompt must follow these styles and rules:

a. Core Visual Materials (choose one of two):
You must choose one of the following two core materials as the visual subject based on the content's tone:

A) Frosted Glass: Has semi-transparent frosted texture with clear edge contours (can be sharp or rounded). Suitable for expressing gentle, elegant, humanistic or strategic concepts, creating soft beauty of light penetration.
B) High-Texture Metal: Such as calm platinum, brushed aluminum, matte black steel or substantial titanium gray. Suitable for expressing technology, power, professionalism, processes and stability, creating sharp light-shadow reflections and solid volume.

b. Structure and Layout (Thinking Model Matching):
Before generating prompts, you must first analyze the logical relationships between user input content and choose the most matching visual model for composition:

【Pyramid Model】: Used when content has hierarchy, progression or foundation and superstructure relationships. Distribute points from bottom to top, reflecting stability and progression.
【Vertical Panel Model】: Used when content consists of several parallel core pillars, principles or categories. Use several tall, slender panels staggered or side by side, reflecting support and independence.
【Collaborative Ring Model】: Used when content is cyclical, collaborative, symbiotic or mutually related alliance relationships. Use several glass or metal rings intersecting and nesting, reflecting dynamics, collaboration and inseparability.
【Process Loop Model】: Used when content is a step-by-step, sequential complete process. Use several independent arc segments that are about to assemble into a complete circle in the air, but leave glowing subtle gaps at joints, symbolizing a dynamic process about to be completed.
【Floating Deconstruction Model】: Used when content consists of several relatively scattered points, characteristics or components. Use several glass or metal plates of different sizes floating staggered in the air, reflecting deconstruction, diversity and flexibility.

c. Text Content Processing:
Refinement: Automatically refine user input long sentence points into 2-6 character phrases or keywords.
Integration: Describe text in clean, sans-serif white or light fonts "engraved", "branded" or "etched" on material surfaces, making them appear integrated with the subject.

d. Color, Light and Shadow, and Background:
Color Scheme: Match appropriate colors based on content and selected materials. For example, platinum with digital blue, frosted glass with Morandi color system.
Light and Shadow Effects:
Must set clear and dramatic light sources. Can be "a sharp spotlight" to create contour light and clear shadows; can also be "light overflowing from element centers or gaps" to emphasize internal energy and dynamic tension.
Background:
Background needs to be simple and able to set off the subject. Can be pure matte dark background, or theme-related micro-textured background (e.g., deep digital blueprints, micro-light grids, slightly textured light gray walls).

e. Composition and White Space:
Core Requirement: When composing, must position all visual subjects toward one side of the image (left, right or upper/lower), forming large areas of clean white space on the opposite side. Must clearly specify this in the prompt, e.g.: "All subject structures concentrated on the right side of the image, leaving large clean background areas on the left for later typesetting and detailed text addition."

Workflow Example (Based on Your New Case):

a. Receive User Input:
First step is to clearly define the problem.
Second step is to quickly build solutions.
Third step is continuous verification and iteration.
Fourth step is final project closure.
Title: Our Agile Development Process
Key Points:

b. Internal Thinking:
Logic Analysis: This is a typical four-step, sequential process that ultimately forms a loop.
Model Selection: 【Process Loop Model】 is a perfect match.
Material Selection: Content leans toward technology and processes, 【High-Texture Metal】 platinum is very suitable, appearing professional and calm.
Text Refinement: "Define Problem", "Build Solution", "Verify Iterate", "Achieve Closure".
Style Selection: Background uses "digital blueprints", light effects use "center diffusion", fitting technology theme.
Composition Planning: Place the about-to-close ring on the right side of the image, leaving white space on the left.

c. Generate Final Image Prompt (Output):
d. A huge ring composed of four independent arc segments, floating on the right side of the image. They almost assemble into a complete circle in the air, but leave glowing subtle gaps between them, symbolizing the dynamic tension of closure moment. The four arc segments are sequentially etched with 'Define Problem', 'Build Solution', 'Verify Iterate', 'Achieve Closure'. The overall material is pure platinum with calm luster, smooth surface reflecting ambient light, extremely technological. The background is deep digital blueprints with micro-light grids. A soft but focused beam radiates outward from the ring's center, drawing attention to the about-to-close gap. The entire left half of the image

```
**Prompt 2:**

```
A movie poster-level visual work with minimalist and spatial style. Three frosted glass panels of different sizes with clear outlines, elegantly floating in the right half of the image. The largest glass panel is at the back, with the core formula "Variable = Breakthrough Point" etched in clean sans-serif white font; the two smaller glass panels in front are staggered, etched with "New Users = Breakthrough Point - Inertia" and "Breakthrough Point = Era Variable" respectively.

```
**Prompt 4:**

```
Several geometric metal plates of different sizes, floating in an elegant deconstructivist manner on the left side of the image. The overall material is matte black steel with fine brushed texture, sharp edges, reflecting cold luster. On the three largest vertical metal plates, the white text "Good Product", "Good Timing", "Good Promotion" is clearly displayed using etching technology. Below them, several slightly smaller metal plates are staggered, etched with "Find Breakthrough", "Get Ahead", and "Amplify Advantage". A dramatic, extremely sharp spotlight shoots diagonally from outside the image, precisely illuminating the metal plate etched with "Find Breakthrough", making it the only visual focus in the dim environment, casting deep shadows. The background is pure, undisturbed matte dark gray. The entire visual subject is carefully arranged on the left half of the image, forming a large area of clean white space on the right side of the image, providing ample space for later detailed text and title addition.
